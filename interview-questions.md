# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React? A keyword in React meaning properties. Used to pass data from component to another component in one direction only.

  Your answer: A keyword in React meaning properties. Used to pass data from component to another component in one direction only.


  Researched answer: Properties or props can be used to pass data using a class- based components or through a function based component. Usually in class based components the keyword "this.' is used. An example is if a car has a prop of 4 wheels, this data can be passed on to any child component of a car.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: Document Object Model events are signal that something is taking place or happening. Can be signaled using interaction or by the browser.

  Researched answer: Basically interaction signals either by the user or the browser. When we click, touch, download, drag, change, resize, input, error, etc.,  we are signaling an event. Whenever we interact with a component we will signal an event. It also happens when the browser is interacting with us because something is happening. Like when the browser returns info, deletes a file, zooms in or out and other similar events.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: When we design software based around data, objects instead of functions and logic. On the otherside functional programming is more based on the function expression

  Researched answer: Object oriented programming as the name implies is looking more on the object that can contain data and code(procedures, may also be referred as methods). A key feature in OOP is the ability of inheritance. Were data can be passed down by parent classes to children in a one way direction. In functional programming it is more based on the mathematical/scientific functions while object-oriented looking more at an object to create the software. Applications of functional programing will be more on scientific, spreadsheets, academia, industry, education and the like



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: Float are numbers with the decimal places. Integers don't usually show values in the decimal flaces

  Researched answer: In some scientific applications numbers with decimal places give more accurate results while financial data is mainly ok with numbers with only 2 decimal places or even just integers. Float may take up more space than integers but are moer accurate in some applications. Integers sacrifice this accuracy on some applications due to the force rounding up of the numbers .



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean? 

  Your answer: when the last command is executed or printed, or shown even without a prompt

  Researched answer: Ruby will return the value of the last evaluated expression. It may make the code simpler but it may also create problem for some
